Hey there, thanks for showing interest in our project! For more information,
read on!

What does this project do?
    The end goal of this project is to create a decentralized encrypted
    messaging app. Employing modern encryption standards on top of a
    peer-to-peer network to reduce the risk posed to the user while their data
    is in transit and the inherent risk of a centralized storage point.

Why is this project useful?
    User data privacy has been very quickly diminishing with the advent of
    targeted adds, IOT devices, and "big data" analytics. Our goal with this
    project is to help our users take back control of their data and privacy in
    a convenient package. Messaging apps such as Snapchat, Wechat, or Facebook
    Messenger have grown exponentially in popularity since their inception and
    the service that they provide has become a staple of social interaction in
    modern society. Unfortunately the data collected from users of these apps
    has been shown again and again to be used in ways undesired by many. Our app
    hopes to allow users to talk freely without the constant fear of "being
    watched" that has come from modern social networks.

How do I get started?
    We reccomend reading our contribution guidelines and taking a look through
    our existing codebase. Our current development team is working on the back
    end of the messaging service and encryption standards so we are currently
    looking for front end mobile developers and mobile network developers,
    although any help is appreciated.

Where can i get more help if i need it?
    Some documentation for the existing sections have been created and are
    listed under the “documentation” folder. There is also a folder of text
    files containing notes from the creators initial idea process that can be
    referenced if you are unsure of where to start. If all that fails to meet
    your needs the lead development team contact information and how to contact
    them appropriately is listed under the “contribution guidelines” file.
